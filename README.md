# Machato

Machato is a native client for various LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and more. It initially began as proprietary software, and is now being released as open source software. Contributions are welcome!

## Buying the app

Machato helps me financially, as such I'm purposefully keeping license checks in place in this app. You can buy a license key (infinite uses, all future updates) at [machato.app](https://machato.app) to show some love! You're free to build the app yourself and adjust those checks, but please refrain from distributing such binaries. If you contributed meaningfully to this repo and wish to obtain a license key, feel free to contact me at `contact[at]machato.app`.

## Building the app

Machato is a SwiftUI app, and should be built as such via Xcode. Clone the repository, make sure all packages are installed, and run the app with Cmd+R.
